# Random Password Generator
This here is a simple random password generator created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is a simple project done millions of times by millions of people who are trying to learn to code. This is my attempt. 

This project helped demonstrate my knowledge of for loops and utilization of the Math.random() method. The most difficult part of this project was seperating the functions in order to allow the user to choose a custom set of parameters that they desire their password.

## Usage 
This application can be installed onto any computer and used in their default browser. It works best in the latest version of Chrome or Firefox. The selected options offer passwords with; uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and or numbers.
